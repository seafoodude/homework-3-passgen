# Homework 3 PassGen

https://seafoodude.github.io/homework-3-passgen/

## Description

This Homework 3 PassGen was created for boot camp students who were going through Module 03. It contains a random password generator that is able to create a random password based on criteria given from the user.

My motivation came from my desire to learn Javascript and apply it in creating a random password generator.
I created this password generator to show that I have learned and absorbed the information given to me through the Module 03 requirement from the UCLA coding bootcamp.
This helped me to achieve a foothold in building more complex and functional Javascript programs in my future projects.
I learned how to build a password generator to display my knowledge and understanding of Javascript.
